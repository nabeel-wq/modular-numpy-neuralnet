# Modular Neural Network

This is a simple implementation of a modular feedforward neural network using backpropagation and different activation functions. It maybe used for comparison of the different functions, or feel free to use it however. Inspired by Michael Nelsen's book 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning'.
